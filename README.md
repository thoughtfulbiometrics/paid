# The Privacy, Accessibility, Inclusion & Diversity (PAID) Framework

As biometric technologies become increasingly important for access to digital services over the next decade, we must put the control of critical risks — privacy, accessibility, inclusion, and diversity — at the center of our attention. These risks are too often left as afterthoughts in the design and implementation of identity systems.  The Privacy, Accessibility, Inclusion and Diversity (PAID) framework was initially designed to organize a questionnaire for the [Thoughtful Biometrics Workshop 2021](https://thoughfulbiometrics.org) and discussed in [this article](https://medium.com/thoughtful-biometrics/being-thoughtful-about-biometrics-1f28ac2a27d5).  This repo is a collection of those risk questions organized by category:

01 - [Privacy Risks](https://github.com/thoughtfulbiometrics/paid/blob/master/01%20Privacy.md)

02 - [Accessibility Risks](https://github.com/thoughtfulbiometrics/paid/blob/master/02%20Accessibility.md)

03 - [Inclusion Risks](https://github.com/thoughtfulbiometrics/paid/blob/master/03%20Inclusion.md)

03 - [Diversity Risks](https://github.com/thoughtfulbiometrics/paid/blob/master/04%20Diversity.md)
